This project revolved around predicting airline delays for multiple airlines using various parameters taken by the airports. We utilized Machine Learning algorithms in order to create models that will best predict airline delays.  

## Methods
- Data Preprocessing
- Undersampling
- Subsetting
- Feature Engineering
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**

## Findings
The main purpose of this project was to generate the best model, so in terms of a conclusion, we weren't able to find an answer to a hypothesis. However, we did discover that the Decision Tree yielded the highest accuracy in terms of predicting whether a plane was delayed or on time. In addition, we found that larger airlines such as United Airlines and Southwest, tended to have more delays as they usually have a higher traffic of people to deal with.
